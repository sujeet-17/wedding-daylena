                other.<br><br>

                After you hire me, I will spend a lot of time getting to know your wedding day inside and out, asking
                your preferences and helping you figuring out timing for photos and lighting on your day.<br><br>

                I will be by your side capturing your memories all day, in the most artistic and documentary way. When
                the party is over and the guests are gone, you will be getting sneak peeks from me to keep re-living
                your day.<br><br>

                Your photos will be delivered in a few weeks and you can share them with friends and family while your
